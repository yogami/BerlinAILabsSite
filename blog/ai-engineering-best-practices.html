                <p class="article-intro">
                    Building AI systems that actually work in production takes more than clever algorithms. You need
                    discipline, a process you can repeat, and honestly? A bit of stubbornness about quality. We've
                    developed a set of practices at Berlin AI Labs that keep our stuff reliable. Here's what works
                    for us.
                </p>

                <h2>The Art of Planning: Think Before You Build</h2>

                <p>
                    Every decent project starts with planning, but not the kind where you write a 40-page doc that
                    nobody reads. I'm talking about actually understanding the problem before you start coding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do this thing we call the "peer planner" approach. You draft a plan. Then you step back and
                    poke holes in it from a different angle, looking for gaps and optimistic assumptions. Then you
                    merge both views into something realistic. It feels slow, but it saves you from rewriting
                    everything two weeks later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best code you'll ever write is the code you don't have to write because you planned properly.
                </p>

                <h2>Code Quality: Your Future Self Will Thank You</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the boring part that makes everything else work. Two rules: write tests first, and
                    leave code cleaner than you found it.
                </p>

                <h3>Test First Isn't Optional</h3>

                <p>
                    New features get tests before they get code. This isn't bureaucracy. If you can't write a test
                    for something, you probably don't understand it well enough to build it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For legacy code, we wrap tests around existing behavior before touching anything. It's a safety
                    net, and it tells you what the code actually does vs. what you think it does.
                </p>

                <h3>Clean Code, Seriously</h3>

                <p>
                    Small functions, one job each, names that make sense. The Robert Martin and Martin Fowler stuff.
                    Some people think this is a luxury. It's not. It's how you maintain a system past month three.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We enforce it with automated checks: no circular dependencies, cyclomatic complexity of 3 or
                    lower per function, zero linter warnings, small focused methods. If a function's trying to do
                    too much, we split it. No debates.
                </p>

                <h2>Fixing Bugs the Right Way</h2>

                <p>
                    Bugs happen. The difference between professional engineering and hacking is what you do about them.
                    Here's our process. It's TDD all the way down.
                </p>

                <h3>1. RED: Reproduce with a Test</h3>

                <p>
                    Write a small test that reproduces the bug. Run it. Watch it fail. This proves you actually
                    understand the problem, and gives you something to verify the fix against.
                </p>

                <h3>2. GREEN: Fix the Code</h3>

                <p>
                    Fix the code until the test passes. Apply SOLID and clean code principles while you're at it.
                    No quick hacks, even if it's tempting.
                </p>

                <h3>3. REFACTOR & Quality Gates</h3>

                <p>
                    Now clean up the structure and readability, keeping all tests green. Check for circular
                    dependencies, keep complexity at 3 or below.
                </p>

                <h3>4. REGRESSION: Full Test Suite</h3>

                <p>
                    Run ALL the tests. Unit tests, prompt tests, everything. Make sure you didn't break something
                    else while fixing this bug.
                </p>

                <h3>5. CODE REVIEW & Verification</h3>

                <p>
                    Someone else looks at it. They check for SOLID violations, code smells, security issues. We
                    also run E2E tests with Playwright against production when we can. If anything's off, we go
                    back to step 1.
                </p>

                <h2>Feature Development: Building with Confidence</h2>

                <p>
                    Same discipline, just for new stuff. Write tests that define what the feature should do. Then
                    implement it, making tests pass one at a time. Each passing test is a checkpoint you can
                    roll back to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After it works, refactor and run quality gates. Then hit the full regression suite. Nothing
                    gets committed until everything's green.
                </p>

                <h2>Prompt Engineering: Treating Prompts as Code</h2>

                <p>
                    In AI systems, prompts are logic. You just can't see them. We treat them as first-class code:
                    versioned, tested, held to the same standards as everything else.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Define What "Good" Looks Like First</h3>

                <p>
                    Before writing a prompt, define what the output should look like. JSON schema, field presence,
                    content rules, edge cases. Be specific.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Write Actual Tests for Prompts</h3>

                <p>
                    Not just "does it return something." Semantic tests that check structure, quality (hook
                    engagement, simplicity), and what happens when the model returns garbage.
                </p>

                <h3>3. The Prompt Test Loop</h3>

                <p>
                    Write acceptance tests. Craft the prompt. Validate with real API calls. Only then does it go
                    into the codebase. Any future changes must pass all existing tests before merging.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Version Your Prompts</h3>

                <p>
                    Just like code. Never edit a prompt without behavior tests in place. This prevents the
                    "silent regression" problem where a well-intentioned tweak breaks an edge case you forgot about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This matters most in production, where prompts get tweaked for performance. Without tests,
                    a small edit can quietly break something that was working fine.
                </p>

                <h2>Why This Matters for AI Systems</h2>

                <p>
                    AI systems have a special talent for failing in subtle ways. Bugs show up under weird conditions.
                    Real-world data is messy. Things fail silently and erode trust before anyone notices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's exactly why the boring engineering stuff matters so much. Our test suites cover edge
                    cases that exercise model behavior in unusual situations. Code reviews question assumptions
                    about data quality. Quality gates stop tech debt from piling up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The payoff? AI systems that work in production, not just in demos. Day after day, with real
                    data from real users.
                </p>

                <h2>It's Never Finished</h2>

                <p>
                    These practices aren't static. When something breaks, we do a blameless retro and ask what
                    process change would've caught it earlier. We keep learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The field moves fast. What worked two years ago might not cut it now. Staying curious isn't
                    optional.
                </p>

                <h2>Where to Start</h2>

                <p>
                    If you're building AI systems, start with testing. Even a handful of well-chosen tests makes
                    a huge difference. Then add quality gates to your CI/CD. Introduce code reviews that focus on
                    maintainability, not just "does it work."
                </p>

                <p>
                    It pays off fast. Fewer bugs, calmer deployments, new team members can actually read the code.
                    The system stays flexible even as it grows.
                </p>
